# MIT-MemMap
Google Maps tool to memorize MIT campus 

## Running
To run this app locally, replace the API key in `index.html` with your own and add `https://0.0.0.0:8000` as being allowed. After this, run a command that will host the entire repository on a local server. I use `python3 -m http.server` as it's included in most machines by default.
